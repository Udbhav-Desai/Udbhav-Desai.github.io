              <p>
                At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Epic's leadership was 
                gearing up to respond quickly to push out software features and implement workflows 
                for in order to best treat and track patients with COVID-19, ICU and emergency room capacity,
                among other key metrics. In addition, once a vaccine was developed, Epic needed 
                to track vaccination administration rates, vaccine volumes and 
                vaccine scheduling availability. Given the urgency of the situation, features to support 
                COVID-19 workflows were developed quickly and they needed to be deployed immediately in a 
                safe manner to custom production systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vaccination Station was the centralized reporting tool used to help Epic's COVID-19 
                support efforts. The tool was a dashboard that brought together key client metrics,
                system availability data, feature implementation data, vaccine administration rates,
                and client escalation surveys. In addition, to centralizing metrics, the dashboard 
                empowered executives and vaccine project managers to take immediate action with features 
                for sending bulk emails and making updates to vaccine project management tools. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For this project I developed a new SQL schema and a dynamic SSIS package to ingest .csv files
                containing key metrics from client production systems on a daily basis. For this spoke of the 
                project, I worked closely with Technical Solution Engineers and Software Developers to understand 
                the logic of new metrics that needed to be collected from customer systems, and acted diligently to 
                develop a framework to store the data into a SQL server so that it could be used to surface on a 
                dashboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, I developed SQL views to pull in data about client vaccination survey results,
                feature implementation metrics and data about key client personnel. Then, I developed a Power BI 
                dashboard to surface all the data in an easily navigable dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once vaccines were developed and began to be administered at customer sites, I developed a 
                  Vaccine Forecast model against Epic customer data and CDC data to understand national Vaccination
                  administration rates, help project clients who may have the most strain of vaccine resources and 
                  understand Epic's impact toward vaccinating the US population.
